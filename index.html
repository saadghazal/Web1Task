          <h3>Batman</h3>
          <p class="character-p">
            Batman, also known as Bruce Wayne, is a DC Comics superhero who
            fights crime after witnessing his parents' murder. He has no
            superpowers, relying on his intellect, physical skills, detective
            abilities, and high-tech gadgets. Operating in Gotham City, he is
            aided by allies like Robin and Alfred. Batman's iconic look includes
            a cape, cowl, and the Bat-Signal. His adversaries, including the
            Joker, Penguin, and Riddler, create a constant battle between
            justice and chaos.

          <h3>Joker</h3>
          <p class="character-p">
            The Joker, Batman's archenemy in DC Comics, is known for his chaotic
            nature and sinister grin. With a tragic and varied origin story, he
            embodies pure anarchy and enjoys causing mayhem. Despite having no
            superpowers, his genius-level intellect and elaborate schemes make
            him a formidable adversary. The Joker's complex relationship with
            Batman highlights themes of duality and the fine line between sanity
            and insanity. He remains one of the greatest villains in comic book
            history.
